# Conclusion to Object Relationships

## Learning Goals

- Understand how object relationships can help us.

## Key Vocab

- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Object**: the more common name for an instance. The two can usually be used
interchangeably.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: programming that is oriented around data
(made mobile and changeable in **objects**) rather than functionality. Python
is an object-oriented programming language.
- **Function**: a series of steps that create, transform, and move data.
- **Method**: a function that is defined inside of a class.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding object-oriented programming relationships, such as one-to-many and many-to-many, as well as aggregation methods, is crucial for designing efficient and maintainable software systems. These relationships help in defining how different objects interact and communicate with each other.

Understanding and correctly implementing these Object relationships and aggregation methods can improve the maintainability of a software system. It ensures proper object management, enhances code readability, and allows for better modeling of real-world scenarios
